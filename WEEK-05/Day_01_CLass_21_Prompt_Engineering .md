# Class 21 – Mastering the Art of Prompt Engineering  
---

## 💡 Introduction to Prompt Engineering (PE)  

- **Prompt (Definition):** The instruction/input given to a Large Language Model (LLM) or Generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).  
- **Prompt Engineering (PE):** The discipline of structuring inputs to elicit desired, high-quality outputs. It’s the **art + science** of talking effectively to AI.  

👉 Think of AI as a **magic helper**:  
- A simple, vague prompt = simple, generic answer.  
- A well-structured prompt = precise, high-value, usable answer.

## ✅ Why is Prompt Engineering Important?  

| **Aspect**       | **Good Prompt** → High Power 🚀 | **Bad Prompt** → Low Power ⚠️ |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Result Quality** | Targeted, accurate, usable output | Vague, confusing, or hallucinated output |
| **Time & Efficiency** | Saves time by getting it right the first time (10X productivity) | Wasted cycles refining bad answers |
| **Control** | Full control over tone, format, persona | Generic or irrelevant responses |

**Key Takeaway:**  
👉 In the future, **prompting effectively** will be a professional skill as essential as using Excel or writing emails.

## 🔑 The S.E.C.R.E.T. Formula for Perfect Prompts  

| Letter | Component              | Description | Example |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|---------|
| **S**  | Specific Task          | State the exact action. Use action verbs (Write, Summarize, Generate). | "Summarize the article into 5 points." |
| **E**  | Example (Few-Shot)     | Give output style/format examples. | "Match this format: [Example]." |
| **C**  | Context                | Add background info or constraints. | "Target market = Gen Z, last quarter’s data only." |
| **R**  | Role/Persona           | Tell AI what role to adopt. | "Act as a Senior Economist." |
| **E**  | Enclosure/Exclusion    | Use delimiters for input + tell what not to do. | """Analyze the text below""" / "Do NOT use jargon." |
| **T**  | Tone & Target          | Define audience + tone style. | "Explain for high-school students in a fun tone." |

### 🛠 Example Prompt with S.E.C.R.E.T.  
> "You are a financial content creator (Role). **Task:** Summarize the article [Enclosure] into 5 shareable bullet points. **Context:** It’s about interest rate hikes in developing nations. **Tone & Target:** Engaging but simple, for college students. **Exclusion:** No jargon or acronyms."
