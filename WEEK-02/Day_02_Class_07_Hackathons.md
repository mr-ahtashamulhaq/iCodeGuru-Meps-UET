## What Exactly is a Hackathon?
- **Intense Collaboration** → Teams rapidly develop a prototype/solution in a short, high-pressure timeframe.  
- **Rapid Prototyping** → Focus on quick innovation and learning; not just coding but creative problem-solving.  
- **Competition & Fun** → Many offer prizes, but the main goals are networking, learning, and building.

## Before the Hackathon: Preparation Checklist
1. **Identify Your Niche** – Choose hackathons aligned with your interests; research themes and past winners.  
2. **Build a Strong Team** – Select teammates with complementary skills (developers, designers, innovators).  
3. **Master Essential Tools** – Be comfortable with Git, IDEs, APIs, SDKs, and your dev stack.  
4. **Refine Your Skills** – Brush up on coding languages, frameworks, debugging, and problem-solving.

## During the Hackathon: Thriving Under Pressure
1. **Stay Hydrated & Energized** – Take breaks, eat healthy, and drink water/coffee.  
2. **Communicate Constantly** – Share progress, blockers, and ideas openly with your team.  
3. **Prioritize & Iterate** – Focus on a minimum viable product (MVP), not perfection.

## After the Hackathon: Maximizing Impact
1. **Reflect & Document** – Note lessons learned, challenges, and outcomes.  
2. **Share Your Work** – Upload to GitHub, DevPost, or personal site.  
3. **Maintain Connections** – Stay in touch with teammates, mentors, and contacts.  
4. **Continue Building** – Expand your prototype into a full project.
