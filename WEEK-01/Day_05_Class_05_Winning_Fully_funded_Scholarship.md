## 🌍 Activities That Strengthen Your Profile  

- **Hackathons** → Show dedication and ability to work with global teams  
- **Volunteer Work** → Teaching, mentoring, community involvement  
- **Coding Competitions** → Harvard CS50X, LeetCode contests

## 🇺🇸 USA vs. Europe  

- **US Education Quality** is superior (Dr. Zafar Shahid: *"American Master's is better than European PhDs."*)  
- **USA should be the first priority**  
- **PhD in USA** → 100% funded + monthly stipend ($2000–$3000)  
- **PhD = Job** (funded by research project grants)  
- **Masters Admission Requirements**:  
  - University only needs to be HEC-recognized (FAST or Virtual University both valid)  
  - What really matters:  
    - CGPA  
    - Problem-Solving (LeetCode)  
    - Strong CV (projects, hackathons, skills)

## 🎯 What to Focus on During BS Degree  

### Academic & Skills  
- Maintain **CGPA ≥ 3.5**  
- Solve **300+ LeetCode problems** (2–3 daily)  
- Strengthen **DSA & problem-solving skills**  
- Write **LinkedIn articles/comments** to showcase communication  

### Competitions & Hackathons  
- Participate in **international hackathons** monthly  

### Misconceptions  
- **Societies/Clubs** (e.g., speech competitions) → No impact for coding jobs (might help in management/marketing roles)  
- **Internships** → Do not guarantee jobs; some are not useful for skill-building  
- **FYP (Final Year Project)** → Focus on full-stack projects (not research-heavy), spend extra time on problem-solving  
- **Research Papers (Undergrad)** → Usually not impactful (most coders at Google are not R&D specialists)

## 📝 Standardized Tests  

### IELTS / TOEFL  
- Both accepted; can substitute each other  
- Validity: **2 years**  

### GRE  
- Harder but accepted by more universities  
- Often required for **Fulbright Scholarships**  
- Validity: **5 years**  
- Strong GRE score → increases chances  
- Can be waived by professors if the profile is strong  
- Many iCodeGuru students got US scholarships **without GRE**
