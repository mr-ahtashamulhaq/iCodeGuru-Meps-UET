# Class 29 – Applied Generative AI: A Practical Masterclass for Students  
**Topic:** Applied Generative AI: A Practical Masterclass for Students  

---

## 🎯 Overview  
This session focused on **how students can practically apply Generative AI (GenAI)** to solve real-world problems, create projects, and build impactful portfolios.  
Students learned about **prompt engineering, multimodal tools (text, image, audio, and code generation)**, and how to use AI in academics, startups, and freelancing.  

---

## 🤖 What is Generative AI?  
Generative AI (GenAI) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can **generate new content**—text, code, images, audio, or video—based on the data they have been trained on.  
Unlike traditional AI that classifies or predicts, **GenAI creates**.  

### 🧩 Key Capabilities:
- Text generation (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)  
- Image generation (Midjourney, DALL·E, Leonardo AI)  
- Audio & music generation (Suno, Udio, Mubert)  
- Video generation (Runway, Pika Labs, Lumen5)  
- Code generation (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Lovable.dev)  

---

## 🧠 How Generative AI Works (Simplified)  
1. **Training on Large Datasets:** AI models learn patterns from billions of examples (e.g., books, code, videos).  
2. **Prompt Input:** You give an instruction (prompt) like *“Write a report on climate change.”*  
3. **Tokenization & Understanding:** The AI breaks text into tokens and predicts the most probable next word.  
4. **Generation:** AI combines learned patterns to generate new, coherent, and creative outputs.

## 🚀 Building a GenAI Project as a Student  

### Step-by-Step Framework:
1. **Identify a Problem:** Choose a real issue (e.g., stress management, study organization, or accessibility in learning).  
2. **Select Tools:** Combine text + image + automation tools (e.g., ChatGPT + N8N + Canva).  
3. **Design Prototype:** Create mockups or demos using Figma or Lovable.dev.  
4. **Develop Workflow:** Automate interactions with AI APIs or prompts.  
5. **Test & Improve:** Collect user feedback and refine prompts.  
6. **Showcase Portfolio:** Upload your AI project on GitHub or a personal website.  

### Example Project Idea:  
> **AI Mental Wellness Assistant**  
> - Chatbot for emotional support and stress tracking.  
> - Uses GPT-4 for conversation, Google Sheets for data, and N8N for automation.
