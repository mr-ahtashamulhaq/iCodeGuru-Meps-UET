# Class 18 ‚Äì Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR): Shaping the Future of Education and Industry

## üåç Introduction
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are two powerful technologies reshaping how we **learn, train, and work**.  
- **AR (Augmented Reality):** Enhances the real world by overlaying digital content.  
- **VR (Virtual Reality):** Creates a fully immersive computer-generated environment.  

Together, AR and VR unlock **immersive learning experiences, safe simulations, and smarter workspaces**, making them essential in **education, industry, and research**.

## üîé What is Augmented Reality (AR)?
- AR overlays **digital elements** (text, images, 3D models) onto the **real-world view**.  
- Experienced via **smartphones, tablets, AR glasses** (e.g., Microsoft HoloLens, Google ARCore, Apple Vision Pro).  

### Key Features:
- Users remain in the **real world** while interacting with **virtual objects**.  
- Supports **move, rotate, and scale** 3D models.  
- Adds **relevant information** in real time (e.g., maps, directions, anatomy labels).  

### Use Cases:
- **Education:** Interactive anatomy apps, virtual chemistry experiments.  
- **Interior Design:** Previewing furniture in a room.  
- **Industry:** AR maintenance guides for machinery.  
- **Navigation:** AR maps overlaying directions on real streets.

## üåê What is Virtual Reality (VR)?
- VR immerses users in a **completely digital world**, cutting off the real environment.  
- Requires **VR headsets** (Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR).  

### Key Features:
- Creates **computer-generated environments** that feel real.  
- Users can **interact, walk, and manipulate objects**.  
- Incorporates **3D graphics, sound, and haptic feedback** for realism.  

### Use Cases:
- **Gaming & Entertainment:** Fully immersive worlds.  
- **Medicine:** Surgery simulations and therapy treatments.  
- **Military & Aviation:** Training pilots and soldiers in safe virtual environments.  
- **Architecture:** Virtual walkthroughs of buildings before construction.
