## 💡 Project Ideas & What Kind of Projects to Build

### What Works Best
- Build something **usable** even if minimal — working prototype over perfect polish.  
- Projects that are **original**, or combine tools in creative ways (AI agent + Web3 + agent registry etc.).  
- Make it **reusable or integrable** (e.g. agents that can be plugged into Coral Registry). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

### Examples of Idea Sources
- Problems in daily life that can be solved via autonomous agents (task automation, knowledge agents, voice AI).  
- Think of social impact or productivity tools.  
- Use partner tools: e.g. voice agents (ElevenLabs), Web3 components (Crossmint).

## 🛠 Project Structure & Presentation Tips

- **MVP first**: nail core functionality before extras.  
- Use modular code & good structure (clear separation of logic, UI, backend).  
- Prepare backup plans (if live demo fails, have a video/recording).  
- For presentation: include problem, solution, demo, impact, future steps.  

---

## 📆 What To Do Now

- Brainstorm and list **2–3 project ideas**.  
- Post them in Discord or work with peers to pick one.  
- Outline roles: who does what.  
- Plan timeline till submission.  

---

## 🌟 Added Tips from Research

- Use **free credits** offered (AI/ML API, Nebius AI, etc.) wisely test small models first. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Keep projects hosted (GitHub), clean code + good README.  
- Include proper **tags** (tech used, category) in submission. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Practice “pitch” or presentation in advance.
