## üìß Crafting Effective Emails to Professors

### Why Email Professors?

Emailing professors is a strategic step for:
- Building connections before applying
- Demonstrating genuine research interest
- Identifying potential supervisors
- Standing out from other applicants

### Email Structure

#### 1. Subject Line & Salutation
- **Subject Line**: Clear, concise, and value-driven
  - ‚úÖ Good: `"Prospective PhD Student ‚Äì Research Interest in Applied Machine Learning"`
  - ‚ùå Poor: `"Question about your program"`

- **Salutation**: Always formal
  - ‚úÖ Use: `"Dear Prof. [Last Name]"`
  - ‚ùå Avoid: `"Hello"`, `"Hey"`, `"Hi"`

- **Best Subject you can Use:**
`Subject: "Prospective Graduate Candidate | Section Leader Mentor @ Stanford | Top Team Lead@ Harvard | IELTS 8.0"`
#### 2. Email Body Components

**Opening Paragraph:**
- Brief introduction with your background
- Mention specific graduation details (university, GPA if strong)
- State your interest in their research

**Middle Paragraph:**
- Reference a specific paper or research area
- Show understanding of their work
- Connect their research to your interests

**Highlight Paragraph:**

## üìú Letters of Recommendation (LOR)

### What are LORs?

Letters of Recommendation provide external validation of your capabilities through trusted academic or professional voices. They offer insights that you cannot provide about yourself.

### LOR Requirements

**Typical Requirements:**
- Usually **3 LORs required**
- **2 academic + 1 professional** (preferred composition)
- Must be from individuals who know your work well

**Best Recommenders:**
- PhD professors who taught you multiple courses
- Final Year Project (FYP) supervisor
- Research advisors or lab supervisors
- Professional supervisors (for work experience)

**Recommender Quality Factors:**
- International PhD or recognized research background
- Current position and reputation in field
- Direct knowledge of your capabilities
- Ability to provide specific examples

### LOR Process

1. **Early Identification**: Identify potential recommenders 2-3 months before deadlines
2. **Formal Request**: Ask in person or via formal email
3. **Provide Materials**: Share your CV, SOP draft, and project details
4. **System Submission**: University contacts recommenders directly through application system
5. **Follow-up**: Gently remind recommenders about approaching deadlines

### Maximizing LOR Effectiveness

**Strategy for Generic Templates:**
Many recommenders use generic templates. To improve quality:

1. **Offer to Draft**: Politely offer to draft the LOR for their review
2. **Provide Specifics**: Give detailed information about:
   - Specific courses and grades
   - Research projects and contributions
   - Personal qualities and achievements
   - Concrete examples and anecdotes

3. **Ensure Personalization**: Make each LOR unique and tailored
4. **Maintain Communication**: Keep recommenders updated on deadlines

**What Strong LORs Include:**
- Specific examples of your work quality
- Comparison to other students (when positive)
- Details about research contributions
- Personal qualities and work ethic
- Potential for graduate study success
